# Peepshow
### Arduino 
Arduino code handles the coin-op and sends serial info based on activity. Also controls stepper-driver based on button input 

### Eagle
Schematic and board for hardware of project connecting coin-op to Arduino-micro, enable transistor control of coin-op to manage when coin-op is functional, and communicate to easy-driver stepper hardware.
